uclibc-dlclose-fix.patch
	Origin: Alpine
	Author: Timo Teräs

	Fix dlclose() to not try to free static TLS symbols. This seems
	to happen on x86_64 with certain .so's. They probably link against
	TLS symbol defined in the main binary (or the loader has additional
	bug on this).

	Needs to be upstreamed

uclibc-rtld_next-fix.patch
	Origin: Alpine
	Author: Timo Teräs

	Fix dlsym(RTLD_NEXT) lookups to search all linked-in modules
	instead of just the first one of them.

	Needs to be upstreamed
